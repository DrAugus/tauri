### Update rust

run `rustup update`

### Error running CLI

#### env key

A **public key** has been found, but no private key. Make sure to set `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable.

> Environment variabled used to sign:  
`TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY`  Path or String of your private key  
`TAURI_KEY_PASSWORD`  Your private key password (optional)  
> refer [tauri-action.yml env TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY](./.github/workflows/tauri-action.yml)

**key password**

```text
Password:
<empty>
Deriving a key from the password and decrypting the secret key... done
Error running CLI: incorrect updater private key password: Wrong password for that key
```

> refer [tauri-action.yml env TAURI_KEY_PASSWORD](./.github/workflows/tauri-action.yml)

## Intro

### Details

> [GUIDE](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/vite)  
> This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

**Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS**

Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports, they are shimmed to be a generic Vue component type by default. In most cases this is fine if you don't really care about component prop types outside of templates. However, if you wish to get actual prop types in `.vue` imports (for example to get props validation when using manual `h(...)` calls), you can enable Volar's Take Over mode by following these steps:

1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VS Code's command palette, look for `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, then right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`. By default, Take Over mode will enable itself if the default TypeScript extension is disabled.
2. Reload the VS Code window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

You can learn more about Take Over mode [here](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471).

### Dev

- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm tauri dev`

### Building

- **Windows Installer**: run `pnpm tauri build`. It will build your Frontend, compile the Rust binary, collect all external binaries and resources and finally produce neat platform-specific bundles and installers.
- **macOS Bundle**: run `pnpm tauri build`. It will build your frontend (if configured, see [beforeBuildCommand](https://tauri.app/v1/api/config#buildconfig.beforebuildcommand)), compile the Rust binary, collect all external binaries and resources and finally produce neat platform-specific bundles and installers.

### Update

ATTENTION: If you lose your private key OR password, you'll not be able to sign your update package and updates will not work.
